            <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
            <p>This Flask web application is designed to provide user authentication functionalities such as user
                registration,
                login, password reset, and user profile management. Additionally, it includes a feature for Named Entity
                Recognition (NER) where users can input text, and the application identifies and extracts named entities
                (such
                as people's names, organizations, locations, etc.) from the text.</p>

            <h2>Import Statements</h2>
            <p>The code imports necessary modules including Flask, render_template, request, redirect, session, a custom
                module named db for database operations, and api for some API operations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flask: Flask is a micro web framework for building web applications in Python.</li>
                <li>render_template: This module is used to render HTML templates in Flask applications.</li>
                <li>request: It is used to access incoming request data in Flask routes.</li>
                <li>redirect: This module is used to redirect the user to a different endpoint or URL.</li>
                <li>session: Session is used to manage user sessions and store session data across requests.</li>
                <li>db: This seems to be a custom module for handling database operations within the Flask application.</li>
                <li>api: Another custom module, possibly for interacting with external APIs and performing related operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>App Initialization</h2>
            <p>An instance of the Flask class is created and assigned to the variable app. Additionally, a secret key is
                set
                for the Flask application. The secret key is used for securely signing session cookies.</p>

            <h2>Database Initialization</h2>
            <p>An instance of the Database class (presumably handling database operations) is created and assigned to
                dbo.

                <li><code>@app.route('/register'):</code> Renders the registration page.</li>

                <li><code>@app.route('/profile'):</code> Renders the profile page if the user is logged in...</li>
                <li><code>@app.route('/ner'):</code> Renders a page for named entity recognition (NER) if the user is
                    logged
                    in...</li>
                <li><code>@app.route('/perform_ner', methods=['POST']):</code> Handles the NER functionality...</li>

            <h2>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</h2>
            <p>Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to identify and classify
                named entities within a body of text into predefined categories such as the names of persons,
                organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

                For example, given the sentence: "Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to
                2017," a NER system would identify "Barack Obama" as a person entity, "President" as an organization
                entity, and "United States" as a geopolitical entity, among others.

                NER is a crucial component in various NLP applications including information retrieval, question
                answering, document summarization, and more. In this project, the Flask application likely uses an API
                for NER to process user input text and extract relevant named entities for display or further
                processing.

                Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive web application with user authentication features
                along with the additional functionality of Named Entity Recognition to analyze and extract structured
                information from unstructured text data.</p>
