            </div>
            <div class="card_text">
                <p>This Flask web application is designed to provide user authentication functionalities such as user registration,
                    login, password reset, and user profile management. Additionally, it includes a feature for Named Entity
                    Recognition (NER) where users can input text, and the application identifies and extracts named entities (such
                    as people's names, organizations, locations, etc.) from the text.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="card_text">
                <p>Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to identify and classify named entities within a body of text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

                    For example, given the sentence: "Barack Obama served as the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017," a NER system would identify "Barack Obama" as a person entity, "President" as an organization entity, and "United States" as a geopolitical entity, among others.
                    
                    NER is a crucial component in various NLP applications including information retrieval, question answering, document summarization, and more. In this project, the Flask application likely uses an API for NER to process user input text and extract relevant named entities for display or further processing.
                    
                    Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive web application with user authentication features along with the additional functionality of Named Entity Recognition to analyze and extract structured information from unstructured text data.</p>
